## How to run the Simulation?
Start the Simulation
  - `mvn clean` to the project directory folder
  - `mvn install` to install required dependencies
  - `mvn build` to build the project 
  - `Run StartUp file` to run the MVN project

### Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
We are using 12 fitness fuctions for the evolution of the Virus Evolution. These are stored in HashTable to perform search and visualization in graphical form.

### Simulation
A simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. Simulations require the use of models; the model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected system or process, whereas the simulation represents the evolution of the model over time. We are using showing the host population and evolution of 3 strong Covid-19 variants affecting host population over the period of time. Model includes naive, recovered and vaccination of host population after one year.

#### Project - Overview 
Our objective is to study the evolution of variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus having a genome consisting of almost 30,000 bases (i.e. A, C, G, or T) with 10 individual genes, on these potential hosts will be either (a) naive (i.e. not infected, not vaccinated), (b) previously infected, (c) vaccinated, (d) previously infected and vaccinated. Implementing the genetic algorithm to evolve new variants and simulating the virus evolution on the host population. And to simulate the virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen behind COVID-19. The simulations take into account different measures taken throughout the pandemic including no restrictions, lockdown, quarantine, social distancing, mask-wearing, testing, and vaccinations.
